            important tasks to be done before going abroad, i.e applying for a

            and education loan, Harshad has reached London, and he is exploring
            the city, looking for a few things, to make his life in London more
            affordable. The first place which he checked is located very close
            to the office which helps the Britishers to visit India (in a legal

            that he can catch the bad guys. This place is located very close to
            the street which is named after something which every country has
            and their citizens must abide by, else, Jake Peralta might arrest
            you! This place is second on Harshad's list. The third place which
            he is considering is located approximately 1 km away from his
            college, this place has 3 universities in very close proximity. It
            is also located near a square whose name is also the first name of a
            famous canadian standup comedian. It shares its name with a famous
            place located in the capital of our country. After checking out all
            these places, Harshad chose the one which was the most affordable
            one.

            opportunity.Since dealing his options was not his forte, he was
            unable to decide on a current price. Hence, his broker helped him
            with the dealing.This is the cheque he was paying to his broker,

            located in the future. We feel sorry for you MI6. Harshad and his
            wife are now guessing what the gift is.

              Q12. Now after being in the finance field for a few years, Harshad
              with his experience has found a sector which has a huge potential
              to grow in future and can give him multifold returns and to better
              secure his child&rsquo;s future by passing his legacy. A sector
              which can even survive pandemics and will also help in one's
              development, learning and enlighten them.
            </p>

            <p>
              In International markets this sector is more developed so this
              gives Indian companies operating in this sector even more
              potential to grow.
            </p>

            <p>
              Three of the most important aspects while looking for investment
              according to him are :- 1. The less effort it takes to please the
              customers to do payment the better business is. 2. The better
              company is able to give profits to shareholders as per CA and CL
              the better the company is. 3. Greater the profit mileage of a
              company the better the company is.
            </p>
